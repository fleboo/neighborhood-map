# Neighborhood Map App Project
This is the final project for Udacityâ€™s Front-End Nanodegree program. The goal of the project is to design a single-page neighborhood map application. For this project, I was tasked with designing the project from scratch and to completion. I used React UI framework and create-react-app to bootstrap my application. 

## Instructions
* Clone the application 
```$ git clone https://github.com/fleboo/neighborhood-map.git```
* Navigation to the project directory 
```$ cd neighborhood-map```
* Install dependencies 
```$ npm install```
* Open the application on a web browser as follows. 
```$ npm start```
* Search for a coffee shop or navigate through the list of all available restaurants

## Dependencies and Acknowledgements
* Javascript is required on the browser
* Google Maps API - map, makers, and icon data
* Foursquare API - restaurant data
* Ryan Waite (Github: ryanwaite28) - Functions to load Google Maps and Foursquare data
